	<p><p>A couple of nights back, I found myself sleepless due to the soaring heat. No mater how hard I tried, I simply couldn't get myself to rest. After several failed attempts, I decided to do something useful. I opened my dusty closet and started at it aimlessly. Incidentally, my eyes met with my old Python programming book.</p>
<p>I had used this book during my initial days of learning to code in Python. I usually don't buy physical copies of programming books, as most of the things I need to know can be found on the internet. But this book was different. It had a very unique approach to learning the concepts of Python programming. It taught the language by using examples of simple terminal based games. Now, these games aren't the high end virtual reality simulation games but rather simple text based and thtough the examples provided in the book, in addition to learning the basics of programming, one can also learn about fundamental concepts that go behind designing games.</p>
<p>I flipped through the pages randomly and then picked up an exercise. The task was to write a program for a Word Jumble game. The concept is very simple. The computer shows a word that is jumbled. The player has to identify the correct word. As I kept progressing through the task, the exercise started to become more challenging. For the second stage, I had to write a code to introduce a trial system, where the user would get only certain number of trials to guess the right answer, failing which, the game will be over.</p>
<p>In the next stage of the task, the challenge was to introduce a scoring system where for every correct answer, the user would be credited with certain score. I spent couple of hours at midnight writing the code and eventually finished the program. I was now able to sleep peacefully, knowing that I had learned something new and with the feeling of having accomplished something.</p>
<p>The name of the book is <em>Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner</em> authored by <em>Michael Dawson</em>. It is a book that helps you learn Python programming while enjoying it at the same time. I've posted the code for word jumble game in my Github repository here: <a href="https://github.com/s4m13337/word-jumble">Word Jumble</a></p></p>
