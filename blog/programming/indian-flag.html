	<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>[2020-01-26]</em></h5>
	<p><p>This morning, I worked on designing the Indian flag with Wolfram Language. I came up with the idea when I was reading a book on creating digital art with Mathematica and thought of starting off my first design with the Indian flag.</p>
<p>Initially it took around 40 minutes to complete the design, as I had to figure out the mathematical functions to draw the curves and the chakra. Once I figured his out, it was just a matter of writing 10 to 15 lines of code and I got this beautiful animation.</p>
