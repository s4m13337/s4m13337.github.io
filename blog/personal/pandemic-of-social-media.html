	<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>[2020-04-22]</em></h5>
	<p><p>As I had anticipated, the quantum of toxic content on Social Media has skyrocketed. And there is a sort of pattern as well. Every 3 to 5 days some thing new trends on an average. In some rare cases, if the content is relatively controversial, it manages to trend a bit longer. Once new content comes up, a blind eye is automatically turned to the old content as if it never happened. And thus the cycle continues. The worst part is, these toxic content are being created at an alarming rate, almost matching the rate at whihc they are being consumed. And I've myself fallen into this trap. My Social Media addiction is at its peak now. </p>
<h3>A Typical Day</h3>
<ul>
<li>8.00 am: Wake up and scroll social media for 15 minutes  </li>
<li>9.00 am to 12:00 am: Watch YouTube/Amazon prime/Netflix  </li>
<li>12.00 am to 1:00 pm: Shower, Prepare lunch and eat  </li>
<li>1.00 pm to 5.00 pm: Try to work whilst passively consuming content on YouTube/Amazon Prime/Netflix  </li>
<li>5.00 pm to 6.00 pm: Take a nap.  </li>
<li>6.00 pm to 10.00 pm: Try to work again whilst passively consuming content on YouTube/Amazon prime/Netflix  </li>
<li>10.00 pm to 12.00 pm: Mindlessly scroll through Instagram or Facebook  </li>
</ul>
<p>My screen time has clocked at almost 18 hours this month. I need to seriously take back control of my life. How do I get out of this trap? Is it really my fault? I am sure there are many others out there like me or even worse than me. How are they dealing with this? Are they dealing with this? Are they even aware that there is a problem? Ugh! I am going crazy. I guess the first step towards a solution is to acknowledge that there is a problem and I am pretty convinced that I am in trouble. I could probably list out the reasons why I consume so much content and then try to tackle them one at a time. Also, maybe listing down the kind of content that I consume in general might help.</p>
<h3>Why am I consuming so much social media?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have too much free time and I don't know what to do other than mindlessly scrolling through social media.  </li>
<li>There is less friction for consuming social media; its easily accessible and once I start something, I just get hooked.  </li>
<li>The content creators are also making the content more and more addictive; they're able to somehow understand what their viewers want at a particular point in time and they tailor their content like wise.  </li>
<li>The social media apps themselves have been designed to be addictive; I just want to keep pulling down the screen to refresh and see if there is anything new happening.  </li>
<li>I am in isolation. There is no one to monitor and support me emotionally when I derail into bad habits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the various kinds of content I am consuming?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Controversial contents  </li>
<li>Fake news debunking videos </li>
<li>ASMR content  </li>
<li>Creepypasta audio stories  </li>
<li>Passive programming tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>As I am writing this, I am not yet in a state of mind to figure out solutions for the above listed problems. I hope I can come out of this in the future. I can feel how much toxic the toxic content has made me at this point. I pray that this is reversible.</p></p>
