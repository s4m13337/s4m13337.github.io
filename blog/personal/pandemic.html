	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Pandemic</h1>
	<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>[2020-03-25]</em></h5>
	<p><p>This month has been a big turmoil. Its intriguing how something so tiny could cause huge chaos. There were some speculations recently that this might happen and indeed it did. Last evening in a public announcement, the Prime Minister finally declared that the Nation is going into a complete lock down in view of the growing number of COVID-19 cases. Shit just got real! I never imagined that the scenrious I hear on <em>Creepypasta</em> stories would one day, to certain extent become a reality. As soon as the announcement was made, I sprinted to the nearby grocery shop to buy as much supplies as possible, although it was said that the emergency and essential services would be open in a controlled manner. I did not want to risk it. </p>
<p>I said that this month started with a "turmoil" because before the Nationwide lockdown came into action, I was kind of in a locked down situation myself. In the beginning of this month, I got infected with Chicken Pox. The night earlier I had gone for a wedding party. While at the party, I was feeling bit more tired than usual and so I left early. After getting home, I slept for a couple hours. I woke up to eat something but I didn't feel good. I slept empty stomach and woke up at around 10 am the next day. I was feeling better slightly, so I decided not to skip work. I reached office at 12.50 pm, the usual time. I was organizing my desk and preparing my work checklist for the day when I suddenly started feeling an itch near my chest. </p>
<p>I continued working but 15 minutes later, I started to feel itch in different places; my chest, under my left arm, near my abdomen and so on. I rushed to the rest room to check out what was up. I took off my shirt and was left in shock. There were bumps all over my body and that was the reason I was feeling the uncontrollable itch. I got scared and turned pale completely. I came out after sometime and told my boss that I've got sick and left the work place. I went to the hospital nearby to check up with the doctor and he confirmed that it was chicken pox. He prescribed around 5 different medicines and I purchased them. I did not know chicken pox medicines are so expensive. On getting back home, I crashed immediately and also informed my flatmate to be careful as chicken pox is contagious. <em>And so began my lockdown...</em></p>
<p>Being sick totally sucks. You want to sleep and rest but the banging head ache makes it impossible. In addition to this for chicken pox you get the complementary itchy skin and you must avoid scratching at all cost or it will just worsen. The worst period was from day 2 to day 5. After day 6, the itch started to reduce and some of the blisters started to break and around day 8 most them had turned into scabs. On the 10th day, I finally decided to apply Neem paste all over my body and took shower. Man, it felt so good to take a shower after 10 days through hell! Post recovery, the following week, our office had already given us the option to work from home. I however decided to go since most of work was residing in the Office's machine. But I returned home after the first half and exactly after 3 hours, our Prime Minister declared it; A nationwide lockdown. </p>
<p>Now, with the lockdown in place, this opens up a completely different angle for work culture, and we are certainly going to be heavily dependent on technology to fill in the gaps for communication. Not to mention, productivity is going to experience a major blow. However I wont be having to go to office and that adds some more time to my day (Umm, thats barely 30 minutes, is this a joke?). Let's see what this lockdown has in store for all of us...</p></p>
