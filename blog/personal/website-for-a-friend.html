	<p><p>I visited my home town last month to give a presentation about Wolfram Language at my university. I conveniently scheduled the visit such that I would be able to spend the weekend there with my family and visit some friends. I got the chance to meet an old friend who had established a successful business there.</p>
<p>She had become a very popular mehendi artist and had a very sound client base. During that fateful weekend, she had opened up a stall at an annual exhibition to demonstate various forms of mehendi. Several customers from various countries were visiting her to get mehendi art done on their arms, shoulders, etc. I too got one on my wrist.</p></p>
