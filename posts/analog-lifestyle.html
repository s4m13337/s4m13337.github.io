<h2 id="orgd5b257f">A Transition to Analog Lifestyle&#x2026;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd5b257f">
<p>
It's 2024, almost a quarter of a century into the 21st century. In the midst of these times where one's life is deeply immersed in the chaotic digital arena, I decided to gradually transition to a simpler analog lifestyle as a resolution for this new year. There are numerous studies that say it takes about 21 days in order for a habit to get ingrained. Today marks the 21st day and therefore I am writing this post in order to document my progress so far.
</p>

<p>
I would like to put it out right away that completely going analog is sadly not possible yet. I tried my best, but there are some tiny stuffs for which I have to still rely on technology. Nevertheless, I have made an effort to cut down the unwanted, mindless areas of digital content consumption and I can already feel a great difference now.

<h3 id="org895d56c">Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org895d56c">
<p>
My starting line for this journey is a bit ahead since I have already stopped using toxic social media like Facebook and Instagram 3 years before. Therefore my new journey has been relatively easier. If there is someone who is still using these services and decides to quit them, it will require a huge amount of will power to let it go. The addiction level is beyond any sane level of measurement and in just 3 years I have seen how much the current generation users have degenerated, developing several mental health problems, stress, insecurities, fake lifestyle and what not.
</p>

<p>
There are several reasons why I took the decision to go as much analog as possible. After quitting social media, I slowly regained my sanity and became more aware of goals and responsibilities, procrastinated less and my overall lifestyle developed. However I continued using other services like YouTube and Reddit for obvious reasons. These services continued to be fine until last year. YouTube started becoming very aggressive with its policies on countering Ad-Blockers. Reddit, despite being a good repository of information started becoming too polarized.

<h3 id="orga9fb9fd">An Experiment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga9fb9fd">
<p>
I carried out an experiment that I started around August last year. I completely turned off my recommendation system on YouTube. I had bookmarked my favorite channels and I had a rough idea of when they posted new videos. So I was able to roughly create schedules for watching the videos. The beginning of this experiment was a bit rough as by then YouTube too had also become quite addictive. I was heavily reliant on the autoplay feature that plays the next video on and on. I turned off this feature too. About a month later, I noticed myself being more disciplied about what channels and videos I watched and when I watched. I also started using the search feature more mindfully.
</p>

<p>
For the second part of my experiment, I reenabled the recommendation system again in November and used it for a month. Guess what, my productivity levels dropped more than 2 times of what I had gained in the previous 3 months. The apparent reason is because I exposed myself to the system after a controlled break of 3 months and therefore my mind wanted to make up for the 3 months that were lost. Therefore, before it could cause me any further damage, I turned it off on New Year's Eve. And it is still off till now. 
</p>

<p>
With Reddit, the problem was similar. Every post had a clickbaity polarizing title just aiming for more karma points. And the comment section is just filled with bashing and thrashing. The content that I used to consume once upon a time for entertainment, unwinding after a long tiring day had become the opposite: every post was aggressive, desperately attempting to swing my emotions to the extreme poles and stealing away my mental peace. Another similar service was Linkedin where things were polar opposite: everyone just painted a polished version of themselves. Any average user can immediately spot the unnatural, unrealistic levels of toxic positivity exhibited there.

<p>
The addiction caused by these services are create a very negative impact on the mental health. I started to feel my attention span deteriorating. There are some studies which have pointed out once the attention capacity is lost, it is very difficult to regain it back. The sooner you try to regain it, the better. Therefore, now is the best time to start. And so I started my mission. However, the human mind is hard to tame. When you cut something addictive off abruptly, the craving doubles and if a relapse occurs, it becomes more destructive as I have explained above in the case of my YouTube experience. In order to have a smoother transition, I needed to properly plan an alternative that would replace the void. I needed to fill the time I consumed YouTube/Reddit with a healthier and equally fulfilling activity.

<p>
I bought 2 new books and a pocket notebook. This might sound very common. Any typical Life Coach / Productivity Gurus give this advise to read books as a replacement for cutting down screentime. But 80% of the time people fail. I was aware of this and identified the problem as well. The reason is simple: In the beginning, people are very motivated about the new activity. This initial motivation is the honeymoon phase; its all pumped up and it leaves faster than you realize it. As a result most people abandon it after a couple of days. To avoid this specifically, I created feasible actionable plans. I took the first book and put in dividers at every 20 pages and told my self that everyday I am allowed to read only up to 20 pages and not a word more than that. If a text ended abruptly, it added an element of suspense that would make me to come back to it the next day to continue. This strategy has worked so far. It is simple and not overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
I also identified the times of the day when I would be mindlessly be consuming digital content. I started filling all those times with activities like exercising, shopping, cleaning, etc. A major portion of the content was consumed when I travel to work. It takes 2 hours to reach my office and 2 hours to comeback which is 4 hours mindless YouTube/Reddit. I deliberately changed my data plan to a lower limit plan (500 mb/month) and now when in train or bus, I take out my pocket notebook and pour down my thoughts. Now I generate my own content and the type of content I've accumulated in my notebook is absolutely astonishing.

<p>
So, after the 21 days mark, I am already feeling great. I feel like I have got back the control over my life. I am more mindful than ever and now I can focus on everything better. My attention span is slightly better now but it is a long way to go. I have not completely been to get rid of the digital ecosystem yet but there is hope and it is a continuous effort and every single day I am stepping closer to an analog lifestyle.
